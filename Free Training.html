<p class="body-text">Understanding cyber security is increasingly important for everyone, not just for those in the tech industry. With the growing reliance on technology in our daily lives, the risks posed by cyber attacks and data breaches are growing as well. As a result, it is essential for everyone to be aware of the potential risks and understand the steps they can take to protect themselves and their personal information online.</p>

  <div style="width:50%;">
       <p><strong>1. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>A DDoS attack is a type of cyber attack that overloads a network or website with traffic from multiple sources, making it unavailable to users. The attackers use bots or malware-infected computers to send massive amounts of data to the target, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate requests. These types of attacks can cause significant disruption to business operations, financial losses, and damage to the company’s reputation.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width:50%;">
    <p><strong>2. SQL Injection Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>An SQL injection attack is a type of cyber attack that targets vulnerabilities in the Structured Query Language (SQL) code used to manage databases. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious SQL commands into the database, which allows them to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. These types of attacks can have devastating consequences, including identity theft, financial losses, and loss of reputation for the affected organizations.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width:50%;">
    <p><strong>3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack is a type of cyber attack that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites, which are then executed by unsuspecting users. The scripts can steal sensitive information, manipulate website content, and redirect users to malicious websites. These types of attacks can be difficult to detect, and can cause significant harm to both the website and its users, including the theft of personal information and financial losses.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width:50%;">
    <p><strong>4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties. The attacker can steal sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial data, or modify the content of the communication without either party being aware. These types of attacks are often carried out by exploiting vulnerabilities in public Wi-Fi networks, making it important for users to be vigilant about the security of their internet connection and the information they transmit over the internet.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="width:50%;">
    <p><strong>5. Phishing Attack:</strong></p>
    <p>A phishing attack is a type of cyber attack that uses social engineering techniques to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. The attackers often use fake emails, websites, or pop-up messages that appear to come from legitimate sources, such as banks, to lure their victims into providing sensitive information. These types of attacks can cause significant financial losses, identity theft, and damage to an individual’s or an organization’s reputation.</p>
